# Project Rules

Rule 1 - In the end of your turn, create a new .md file into the `ai` folder with what you've learned + commands you did + what you will do next!

## Linking

- **ALWAYS use static linking** - Never use dynamic libraries (.dylib, .so)
- Use object files (.o) or static libraries (.a) that can be loaded by the JIT
- For jank integration, compile C/C++ code to object files that can be loaded directly
